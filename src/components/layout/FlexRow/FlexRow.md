### Summary

`<FlexRow />` is meant to be a child of `<FlexContainer />`.

- If your goal is to make a nested layout, then it can also be a child of a `<FlexCol />` or any JSX element.
- **Be mindful** that it needs to have `<FlexCol />` as its direct child.
- See [`<FlexCol />`](/#/Components/Layout/FlexCol) docs for usage examples.
