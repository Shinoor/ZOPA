### Summary

<Card.Image /> renders a div with a background image laid out differently depending on the `layout` prop given to parent `<Card />`.
It also provides `overlayWith` prop which you can use to make the image clickable.

- It's meant to be used along with other [`<Card>`](/#/Components/Organisms/Card/Card) components.
- Check out [`<Card />`](/#/Components/Organisms/Card) examples to see how they're all meant to play together.
